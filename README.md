# Traffic Stop Simulation
## Overview

The Traffic Stop Simulation is an interactive web project that simulates a basic traffic scenario using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the help of the Three.js library for WebGL graphics. In this simulation, users can toggle a traffic light, affecting the movement of cars on a virtual road.

## Features

- **3D Visualization:** Utilizes Three.js to create a visually appealing 3D environment.
- **Interactive Traffic Light:** Users can manually toggle the traffic light between red and green states.
- **Car Movement:** Cars move forward on the road when the traffic light is green.

## Technologies To Be Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Three.js- A cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
