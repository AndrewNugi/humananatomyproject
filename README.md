# Traffic Stop Simulation
## Overview

The Traffic Stop Simulation is a web-based project that simulates a basic traffic scenario using Python (Flask) for server-side logic and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for client-side rendering. The simulation includes a 3D visualization of a traffic stop using WebGL with the help of Three.js.

## Features

- **Flask Server:** Utilizes Flask, a Python web framework, for server-side logic and handling HTTP requests.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Implements the front-end using standard web technologies, providing structure, styling, and interactivity.
- **Three.js and WebGL:** Renders interactive 3D graphics in the browser for a realistic traffic stop simulation.

## Technologies To Be Used

- Python (Flask)
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Three.js - A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application script handling server-side logic.
- `templates/index.html`: HTML template for rendering the web page.
- `static/game.js`: JavaScript file containing the Three.js code and client-side logic.
- `static/styles.css`: CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
